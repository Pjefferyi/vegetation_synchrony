This repository contains the scripts that I used to extract data from the MODIS/Terra+Aqua Land Cover Dynamics Yearly L3 Global 500m SIN Grid V061 dataset.

I used the Google Earth Engine library in Python to access this dataset on the Google Earth Engine catalog ("MODIS/061/MCD12Q2"). 

In order to use Python and the gee library in the Rstudio IDE, you can follow the instructions here: https://philippgaertner.github.io/2020/10/use-gee-python-api-in-rstudio/

These instructions suggest writing Python code in a R markdown file, but you can also create and edit Python scripts directly in Rstudio.
